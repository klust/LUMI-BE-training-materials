About `ls -l`: 

The ls -l command displays information such as ownership, permission, and size of all files and directories. The information on ownership and permission metadata is stored on the MDTs. However, the file size metadata is only available from the OSTs. So, the ls -l command issues RPCs to the MDS/MDT and OSSes/OSTs for every file/directory to be listed. RPC requests to the OSSes/OSTs are very costly and can take a long time to complete if there are many files and directories.

About Lustre becoming unmounted...

There have been a few incidents on Maya where usersâ€™ jobs encountered problems while accessing their executables on the /umbc/lustre filesystem. The main issue is that the Lustre clients can become unmounted temporarily when there is a very high load on the Lustre filesystem. This can cause a bus error when a job tries to bring the next set of instructions from the inaccessible executable into memory.

Executables run slower when run from the Lustre filesystem. It is best to run executables, or any linked libraries, from your home filesystem (or group_saved space if available) on Maya. Libraries are especially susceptible to issues as lustre does not have any sense of file locking. On rare occasions, running executables from the Lustre filesystem can cause executables to be corrupted. Avoid copying new executables over existing ones of the same name within the Lustre filesystem. The copy causes a window of time (about 20 minutes) where the executable will not function. Instead, the executable should be accessed from your home filesystem during runtime.
