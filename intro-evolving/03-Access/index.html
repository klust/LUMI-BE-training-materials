<p>EuroHPC currently funds 
<a href="https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/supercomputers/our-supercomputers_en">supercomputers in four different classes</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There are a number of so-called petascale supercomputers. The first ones of those are
    <a href="https://docs.lxp.lu/">Meluxina</a> (in Luxembourg), 
    <a href="https://en-vegadocs.vega.izum.si/">VEGA</a> (in Slovenia),

    <a href="https://macc.fccn.pt/resources#deucalion">Deucalion</a> (in Portugal).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A number of pre-exascale supercomputers, LUMI being one of them. The other two are 
    <a href="https://wiki.u-gov.it/confluence/display/SCAIUS/LEONARDO+User+Guide">Leonardo</a> (in Italy)
    and <a href="https://www.bsc.es/supportkc/docs/MareNostrum5/intro/">MareNostrum 5</a> (in Spain)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A decision has already been taken on two exascale supercomputers: 
    <a href="https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/ias/jsc/jupiter">Jupiter</a> (in Germany) and
    <a href="https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/new-call-procure-european-exascale-supercomputer-alice-recoque-2024-09-09_en">Alice Recoque</a>,

    Jupiter is currently being built.</p>
<p>The construction of Jupiter has already started and will continue in the first half of 2025.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another 4 mid-range systems are currently under procurement or under construction,
    including <a href="https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/daedalus-call-acquire-new-european-world-class-supercomputer-greece-2024-06-25_en">Daedalus</a> (in Greece) and
    <a href="https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/sweden-will-host-new-eurohpc-supercomputer-2023-06-19_en">Arrhenius</a> (in Sweden).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There will soon be a programme for "AI-optimised" supercomputers, whatever that will mean,
    as these will be very large systems serving lots of users so there will still be lots of
    technological compromises.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Depending on the machine, EuroHPC pays one third up to half of the bill, while the remainder of the budget
comes from the hosting country, usually with the help of a consortium of countries.
For LUMI, EuroHPC paid half of the bill and is the actual owner of the machine.</p>

<!-- BELGIUM -->
<p>LUMI is hosted in Finland but operated by a consortium of 11 countries, with Belgium being the third largest
contributor to LUMI and the second largest in the consortium of countries. The Belgian contribution is
brought together by 4 entities:</p>
<ol>
<li>BELSPO, the science agency of the Federal government, invested 5M EURO in the project.</li>
<li>The SPW Économie, Emploi, Recherche from Wallonia also invested 5M EURO in the project.</li>
<li>The Department of Economy, Science and Innovation (EWI) of the Flemish government invested 3.5M EURO in the project.</li>
<li>Innoviris (Brussels) invested 2M EURO.</li>
</ol>
<p>The resources of LUMI are allocated proportional to the investments. As a result EuroHPC can allocate half
of the resources. The Belgian share is approximately 7.4%.</p>
<p>Each LUMI consortium country can set its own policies for a national access program, within the limits of
what the supercomputer can technically sustain. In Belgium, the 4 entities that invested in LUMI do so together
via a competition (3 calls a year for regular projects).
The access conditions for projects in the Belgian share are advertised via the 
<a href="https://www.enccb.be/GettingAccess">EuroCC Belgium National Competence Centre</a>.
As Belgium is fully responsible for the allocation of its share, the central
LUMI User Support Team (LUST) cannot manage allocations. It makes no sense to send
them requests for a larger allocation or project extension.</p>

<!-- GENERAL More general text
LUMI is hosted in Finland but operated by a consortium of 11 countries.
The resources of LUMI are allocated by each investor proportional to their contribution in the project.
Each LUMI consortium country can set its own policies for a national access program, within the limits of
what the supercomputer can technically sustain. There is a 
["Get Started" page on the main LUMI website](https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu/get-started/)
with links to the various access programs.
So note that the LUMI User Support Team (LUST) does not manage allocations, so it makes no sense
to send us mail for a larger allocation or a project extension.

<p>LUMI works like most European large supercomputers: Users are members of projects.</p>
<!-- BELGIUM
A project corresponds to a coherent amount of work that is being done by a single person or a collaboration
of a group of people. It typically corresponds to a research project, though there are other project types also,
e.g., to give people access in the context of a course, or for organisational issues, e.g., a project for VSC support.
Most projects are short-lived, with a typical duration of 4 to 6 months for benchmarking projects or one year for a 
regular project (which is the maximum duration agreed upon in the consortium).

END GENERAL -->

<p>Projects are also the basis for most research allocations on LUMI. In LUMI there are three types of resource allocations,
and each project needs at least two of them:</p>
<ol>
<li>A compute budget for the CPU nodes of LUMI (LUMI-C and the CPU-only large memory nodes), 
    expressed in core-hours.</li>
<li>A compute budget for the GPU nodes of LUMI (LUMI-G and the visualisation nodes), 
    expressed in GPU-hours. As the mechanism was
    already fixed before it became publicly known that for all practical purposes one AMD MI250X GPU
    should really be treated as 2 GPUs, one GPU-hour is one hour on a full MI250X, so computing for one
    hour on a full LUMI-G GPU node costs 4 GPU-hours.</li>
<li>A storage budget which is expressed in TB-hours. Only storage that is actually being used is charged
    on LUMI, to encourage users to clean up temporary storage. The rate at which storage is charged depends
    on the file system, but more about that later when we discuss the available file spaces.</li>
</ol>
<!-- BELGIUM -->
<p>These budgets are assigned and managed by the resource allocators, not by the LUMI User Support Team.
For Belgium the VSC and CÉCI both have the role of resource allocator, but both use a common help desk.</p>

These budgets are assigned and managed by the resource allocators, not by the LUMI User Support Team.

<p>LUMI projects will typically have multiple project numbers which may be a bit confusing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each RA may have its own numbering system, often based on the numbering used for the project
    requests. Note that the LUMI User Support Team is not aware of that numbering as it is purely
    internal to the RA.</li>
<li>
<p>Each project on LUMI also gets a LUMI project ID which also corresponds to a Linux group to manage
    access to the project resources. These project IDs are of the form <code>project_465XXXXXX</code> for most
    projects but <code>project_462XXXXXX</code> for projects that are managed by the internal system of 
    CSC Finland. </p>
<p><strong>This is also the project number that you should mention when contacting the 
central LUMI User Support.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<figure style="border: 1px solid #000">
<p><img alt="Slide Projects and users 2" loading="lazy" src="https://465000095.lumidata.eu/training-materials-web/intro-evolving/img/LUMI-BE-Intro-evolving-03-Access/ProjectsUsers_2.png" /></p>
</figure>
<p>Besides projects there are also user accounts. 
Each user account on LUMI corresponds to a physical person, and user accounts should
not be shared. Some physical persons have more than one user account but this is an
unfortunate consequence of decisions made very early in the LUMI project about how projects on
LUMI would be managed. Users themselves cannot do a lot without a project as all a user
has on LUMI is a small personal disk space which is simply a Linux requirement. 
To do anything useful on LUMI users need to be member of a project.
There are also "robot accounts" for special purposes 
that would not correspond to a physical person but have a specific goal 
(like organising data ingestion from an external source) but few projects are granted
such an account.</p>
<p>There ia a many-to-many mapping between projects and user accounts.
Projects can of course have multiple users who collaborate in the project, but a user account
can also be part of multiple projects. The latter is more common than
you may think, as. e.g., you may become member of a training project when
you take a LUMI training.</p>
<p>Most resources are attached to projects. The one resource that is attached to a user account
is a small home directory to store user-specific configuration files. That home directory
is not billed but can also not be extended. For some purposes you may have to store things
that would usually automatically be placed in the home directory in a separate directory,
e.g., in the project scratch space, and link to it. This may be the case when you try to convert

<p>A large system like LUMI with many entities giving independent access to the system to users 
needs an automated system to manage those projects and users. There are two such systems
for LUMI. CSC, the hosting institution from Finland, uses its own internal system to manage
projects allocated on the Finnish national share. This system manages the "642"-projects.
The other system is called Puhuri and is developed in a collaboration between the Nordic countries
to manage more than just LUMI projects. It can be used to manage multiple supercomputers
but also to manage access to other resources such as experimental equipment. 
Puhuri projects can span multiple resources (e.g., multiple supercomputers so that you can
create a workflow involving Tier-2, Tier-1 and Tier-0 resources).</p>
<!-- BELGIUM -->
<p>In Belgium two entities manage projects for the Belgian LUMI organisation: VSC and CÉCI.
These entities are called the resource allocators.</p>
<p>All projects allocated by Belgium ara managed through the Puhuri system, and VSC and CÉCI 
both have their own zone in that system. For Belgium it is only used to manage access to LUMI,
not to any of the VSC, CÉCI or Cenaero systems or other infrastructure.
Belgian users log in to the Puhuri portal via MyAccessID, which is a GÉANT service. GÉANT is 
the international organisation that manages the research network in Europe. 
MyAccessID then in turn connects to your institute identity provider and a number of alternatives.
It is important that you always use the same credentials to log in via MyAccessID, otherwise
you create another user in MyAccessID that is unknown to Puhuri and get all kinds of strange
error messages.</p>
<p>The URL to the Puhuri portal is: <a href="https://puhuri-portal.neic.no/">puhuri-portal.neic.no</a>.</p>
<!-- END BELGIUM -->

<!-- GENERAL More general text
There are multiple frontends in use for Puhuri. Some countries use their own frontend
that links to the Puhuri backend to give their users a familiar feeling, while other 
countries use a Puhuri frontend that they either host and manage themselves, or run
on the Puhuri infrastructure. Due to this diversity, we cannot really demo project
management in the course but need to leave this to the local organisations.

The login to Puhuri is in general via MyAccessID, which is a GÉANT service. GÉANT is 
the international organisation that manages the research network in Europe. 
MyAccessID then in turn connects to your institute identity provider and a number of alternatives.
It is important that you always use the same credentials to log in via MyAccessID, otherwise
you create another user in MyAccessID that is unknown to Puhuri and get all kinds of strange
error messages. MyAccessID is also used for ssh key management, so that in the future, when
MyAccessID might serve more machines, you'd have a single set of ssh keys for all infrastructures.

<p>Puhuri can be used to check your remaining project resources, but once your user account

<p>The only permanent file space linked to a user account is the home directory which is of the form
<code>/users/&lt;my_uid&gt;</code>. It is limited in both size and number of files it can contain, and neither limit
can be expanded. It should only be used for things that are not project-related and first and
foremost for those things that Linux and software automatically stores in a home directory like
user-specific software configuration files. It is not billed as users can exist temporarily without
an active project but therefore is also very limited in size.</p>

<p>Each project also has 4 permanent or semi-permanent file spaces that are all billed against the
storage budget of the project.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Permanent (for the duration of the project) storage on a hard disk based Lustre filesystem
    accessed via <code>/project/project_46YXXXXXX</code>. This is the place to perform the software installation
    for the project (as it is assumed that a project is a coherent amount of work it is only 
    natural to assume that everybody in the project needs the same software), or to store input data
    etc. that will be needed for the duration of the project.</p>
<p>Storing one TB for one hour on the disk based Lustre file systems costs 1 TB-hour.
As would storing 10 GB for 100 hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Semi-permanent scratch storage on a hard disk based Lustre filesystem accessed via
    <code>/scratch/project_46YXXXXXX</code>. Files in this storage space can in principle be erased

    automatically after 30 days. This is not happening yet on LUMI, but will be activated if
    the scratch storage space starts to fill up.</p>
<p>Storing one TB for one hour on the flash based Lustre file system costs 10 TB-hour, also reflecting
the purchase cost difference of the systems.</p>

</figure>
<p>The slide above also shows the quota on each volume.
This information is also <a href="https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/storage/">available in the LUMI docs</a>.</p>
<!-- BELGIUM -->
<p>The use of space in each file space is limited by block and file quota. Block quota limit the
capacity you can use, while file quota limit the number of so-called inodes you can use. Each file,
each subdirectory and each link use an inode.
As we shall see later in this course (in the <a href="../09-Lustre/">section on Lustre</a>)
or as you may have seen in other HPC courses already
(e.g., the VSC <a href="https://klust.github.io/SupercomputersForStarters/">Supercomputers for Starters</a> 
course organised by UAntwerpen),
parallel file systems are not built to deal with hundreds of thousands of small files and are
very inefficient at that. Therefore block quota on LUMI tend to be rather flexible (except for
the home directory) but file quota are rather strict and will not easily get extended.
Software installations that require tens of thousands of small files should be done in 
containers (e.g., conda installations or any big Python installation) while data should also
be organised in proper file formats rather than being dumped on the file system abusing the file
system as a database.</p>

-->

<p>In the above slide, the "Capacity" column shows the block quota
and the "Files" column show the total number of so-called inodes available in the file space.</p>
<p>The project file spaces can be expanded in capacity within the limits specified.
However, as big parallel file systems are very bad at handling lots of small files
(see also the <a href="../09-Lustre/">session on Lustre</a>), the files quota (or more accurately
inode quota) are rather strict and not easily raised (and if raised, not by an order
of magnitude).</p>
<p>So storage use on LUMI is limited in two independent ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Traditional Linux block and file quota limit the maximum capacity you can use (in volume and number of
    inodes, roughly the number of files and directories combined).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But actual storage use is also "billed" on a use-per-hour basis. The idea behind this is that a user may
    run a program that generates a lot of data, but after some post-processing much of the data can be deleted
    so that other users can use that capacity again, and to encourage that behaviour you are billed based not
    on peak use, but based on the combination of the volume that you use and the time you use it for. </p>
<p>Storage use is monitored hourly for the billing process. 
If you run out of storage billing units, you will not be able to run jobs anymore.</p>
<p>Storage in your home directory is not billed but that should not mean that you should 
abuse your home directory for other purposes then a home directory is meant to be used, 
and an extension of the home directory will never be granted. If you run out of space
for, e.g., caches, you should relocate them to, e.g., your scratch space, which can sometimes
be done by setting an environment variable and in other cases by just using symbolic
links to preserve the structure of the caching subdirectories in your home directory while
storing data elsewhere.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Quota extensions are currently handled by the central LUMI User Support Team. 
But storage billing units, just as any billing unit, comes from your resource allocator
(so LUMI-BE for projects assigned through the Belgian channel and EuroHPC themselves for
their projects),

<p>LUMI has four disk based Lustre file systems that house <code>/users</code>, <code>/project</code> and <code>/scratch</code>.
The <code>/project</code> and <code>/scratch</code> directories of your project will always be on the same parallel
file system, but your home directory may be on a different one. Both are assigned automatically
during project and account creation and these assignments cannot be changed by the LUMI User Support Team.
As there is a many-to-many mapping between user accounts and projects it is not possible to
ensure that user accounts are on the same file system as their main project. In fact, many users
enter LUMI for the first time through a course project and not through one of their main compute
projects...</p>
<p>It is important to note that even though <code>/flash</code> is SSD based storage, it is still a parallel file 
system and will not behave the way an SSD in your PC does. The cost of opening and closing a file
is still very high due to it being both a networked and a parallel file system rather than a
local drive. In fact, the cost for metadata operations is not always that much lower as on the hard disk based
parallel file systems as both use SSDs to store the metadata (but some metadata operations
on Lustre involve both the metadata and object servers and the latter are faster on <code>/flash</code>). 
Once a file is opened and with
a proper data access pattern (big accesses, properly striped files which we will discuss later
in this course) the flash file system can give a lot more bandwidth than the disk based ones.</p>
<p>It is important to note that LUMI is not a data archiving service or a data publishing
service. "Permanent" in the
above discussion only means "for the duration of the project". There is no backup, not even
of the home directory. And 90 days after the end of the project all data from the
project is irrevocably deleted from the system. User accounts without project will also
be closed, as will user accounts that remain inactive for several months, even if an
active project is still attached to them.</p>
<!-- BELGIUM -->
<p>If you run out of storage billing units, access to the job queues or even to the storage 
can be blocked and you should contact your resource allocator for extra billing units.
Our experience within Belgium is that projects tend to heavily under-request storage
billing units. It is important that you clean up after a run as LUMI is not meant for
long-term data archiving. But at the same time it is completely normal that you cannot do 
so right after a run, or as a job may not launch immediately, that you need to put input
data on the system long before a run starts. 
So data needed for or resulting from a run has to stay on the system for a few days or weeks,
and you need to budget for that in your project request.</p>

<p>LUMI currently has 4 login nodes through which users can enter the system via key-based ssh.
The generic name of those login nodes is <code>lumi.csc.fi</code>. Using the generic names will put you
onto one of the available nodes more or less at random and will avoid contacting a login node
that is down for maintenance. However, in some cases one needs to enter a specific login node. 
E.g., tools for remote editing or remote file synchronisation such as Visual Studio Code or Eclipse 
usually don't like it if they get a different node every time they try to connect, e.g., because 
they may start a remote server and try to create multiple connections to that server.
In that case you have to use a specific login node, which you can do through the names
<code>lumi-uan01.csc.fi</code> up to <code>lumi-uan04.csc.fi</code>. 
(UAN is the abbreviation for User Access Node, the term Cray uses for login nodes.)</p>
<p>It is entirely normal that one of the login nodes is down and not functioning. It will then be
taken out of the <code>lumi.csc.fi</code> list. But don't send support tickets about it. Sometimes a node may even
be unavailable for several weeks as it may be in use by the sysadmins for other purposes. If you're
connecting to a specific login node and it doesn't work anymore, simply try a different one.</p>

<p>Key management is for most users done via MyAccessID: <a href="https://mms.myaccessid.org/">mms.myaccessid.org</a>.
This is the case for all user accounts who got their first project on LUMI via Puhuri, which is the case for
almost all Belgian users. User accounts that were created via the My CSC service have to use
the <a href="https://my.csc.fi/">my.csc.fi</a> portal to manage their keys. It recently became possible to link
your account in My CSC to MyAccessID so that you do not get a second account on LUMI ones you join a 
Puhuri-managed project, and in this case your keys are still managed through the My CSC service.
But this procedure is only important for those LUMI-BE users who may have gotten their first access 
to LUMI via a project managed by CSC.</p>

<p>LUMI also provides a web interface via Open OnDemand. The URL is
<a href="https://www.lumi.csc.fi/"><code>https://www.lumi.csc.fi/</code></a>. It also offers a number
of tools that can be useful for visualisation via a web browser via the "Desktop" app,
which will give you a VNC session with the
rather lightweight <a href="https://www.xfce.org/">Xfce desktop environment</a>.
Note that the supercomputer is not your primary graphics workstation and is a shared resource,
so a more lightweight solution is chosen to be able to serve more users on the available hardware.
It makes no sense to request much richer environments such as Gnome or KDE; they are simply too
heavyweight and would require to dedicate too much of the budget to hardware for something that
is not the core task of a supercomputer.</p>

<p>There is currently not much support for other technologies for GUI applications on LUMI. 
Running X11 over ssh (via <code>ssh -X</code>) is unbearably slow for users located in Belgium. 
The X11 protocol is really made for local area network connections, not
for wide area network connections.

<p>The list of pinned apps may change over time, and more apps are available via the menu at the top.
Most apps will run in the context of a job, so you will need billing units, and those apps will also
present you with a form to chose the resources you want to use, but that will only be discussed in
<a href="../07-Slurm/">the session on Slurm</a>.</p>
<p>Two apps don't run in the context of a job: The "Login node shell" and "Home Directory" apps, and we'll first
have a look at those.</p>

</figure></p>
<p>The "Login node shell" does just what you expect from it": It opens a tab in the browser with a shell
on one of the login nodes. Open OnDemand uses its own set of login nodes, as you can see from the name
of the node, but these nodes are otherwise identical to the login nodes that you access via an ssh client
on your laptop, and the same policies apply. They should not be used for running applications and only be
used for small work or not too heavy compilations.</p>
<p><figure markdown style="border: 1px solid #000">

<p>Let's now select the "Home Directory" app. We get:</p>

</figure></p>
<p>The "Home Directory" app presents you with an interface through which you cannot only browse
your home directory, but also the project, scratch and flash directories of all your projects.
It can be used for some elementary file access and also to upload and download files.</p>
<p>It is not suitable though to upload or download very big files, or download large subdirectories
(multiple files will be packed in a ZIP archive) as browsers may not be reliable enough and as there
are also restrictions on how big an archive Open OnDemand can create.</p>
<p>For transferring lots of data, transfer via LUMI-O is certainly the better option at the moment.</p>

<p>Finally, let's have a look at the "Desktop" app.</p>
<p>The "Desktop" app will present you with a simple GUI desktop based on the
<a href="https://www.xfce.org/">xfce desktop environment</a>. After opening this app, one gets:</p>

</figure></p>
<p>This app needs to run in the context of a job
and although it can run on several partitions on LUMI, its main use is to be able to use some
visualisation applications, so your best choice is likely to use the partition <code>lumid</code> with visualisation
GPUs (see the <a href="../07-Slurm/">session on Slurm</a>). As we have not discussed jobs yet, we will not give more details
now on how to fill in the form that is presented to you.</p>
<p>Now click "Launch" to launch the job, and after a while, you'll see a screen similar to</p>

<p>The desktop is basically run in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing">VNC session</a>,
a popular protocol for remote desktop support in Linux. It can be used through a web browser, which is what
you get if you click the "Launch Desktop" button, but there are other choices also.</p>

of applications.</p>
<p>Note that using "Logout" in this menu is not enough to kill the job. You can do so though with the 
<code>Cancel</code> button in the tab where we clicked the "Launch Desktop" button.</p>
<p>This is in no means meant to be a replacement of your own workstation, so the software choice is limited
and will remain limited. It should never be your main environment for all your work. LUMI is not meant to
simply provide small workstations to all of Europe. And it will also react a lot slower than what you are
used to from a workstation in front of you. This is 100% normal and simply the result of using a computer
which is far away so there is a high network latency.</p>

<p>There are currently two main options to transfer data to and from LUMI.</p>
<p>The first one is to use <strong>sftp</strong> to the login nodes (or any other protocol that goes over the
ssh daemon, like <code>rsync</code> over an ssh connection), authenticating via your ssh key. 
There is a lot of software available for all major operating systems, both command line
based and GUI based. The sftp protocol can be <strong>very slow over high latency connections</strong>.
This is because it is a protocol that opens only a single stream for communication
with the remote host, and the bandwidth one can reach via a single stream in the 
TCP network protocol used for such connections, is limited not only by the bandwidth of
all links involved but also by the latency. After sending a certain amount of data, the
sender will wait for a confirmation that the data has arrived, and if the latency is
high, that confirmation takes more time to reach the sender, limiting the effective
bandwidth that can be reached over the connection. LUMI is not to blame for that;
the whole path from the system from which you initiate the connection to LUMI
is responsible and every step adds to the latency. We've seen many cases where the
biggest contributor to the latency was actually the campus network of the user.</p>
<!-- BELGIUM -->
<p>The second important option is to <strong>transfer data via the object storage system LUMI-O</strong>.
To transfer data to LUMI, you'd first push the data to LUMI-O and then on LUMI pull it 
from LUMI-O. When transferring data to your home institute, you'd first push it onto
LUMI-O from LUMI and then pull the data from LUMI-O to your work machine. 
LUMI offers some support for various tools, including 
<a href="https://rclone.org/">rclone</a>
and <a href="https://s3tools.org/s3cmd">S3cmd</a>.
There also exist many GUI clients to access object storage. 
Even though in principle any tool that can connect via the S3 protocol can work,
the LUMI User Support Team nor the local support in Belgium can give you instructions
for every possible tool. 
Those tools for accessing object storage tend to set up multiple data streams and hence
will offer a much higher effective bandwidth, even on high latency connections.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can also chose to access external servers from LUMI if you have client
software that runs on LUMI (or if that software is already installed on LUMI, e.g., <code>rclone</code>
and <code>S3cmd</code>), but neither the LUMI User Support Team not the Belgian local support teams
can tell you how to configure tools to use an external service that they don't have access
to. But, e.g., the VSC Tier-0 support team might be able to help you to configure a tool
to access the data services that VSC offers.</p>

<p>Using the LUMI-O object storage will be further discussed in the

<p>Unfortunately there is no support yet for Globus or other forms of gridFTP. 
LUST offers a <a href="https://lumi-supercomputer.github.io/LUMI-EasyBuild-docs/u/unicore-uftp/">recipe to install the UNICORE UFTP client</a>
if you have access to a UFTP server (still popular in Germany), but neither LUST nor local 
Belgian support teams can offer true support for that either as
they have no access to such server. How to work with these recipes, is discussed in the
<a href="../05-SoftwareStacks/">"LUMI Software Stacks" session of this course</a>.</p>
