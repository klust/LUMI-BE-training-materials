# HPE Cray Programming Environment

<!-- *Presenter: Kurt Lust*  -->

As Linux itself is not a complete supercomputer operating system, many components
that are essential for the proper functioning of a supercomputer are separate packages
(such as the [Slurm scheduler](M06-Slurm.md) discussed later in this course) 
or part of programming environments. 
It is important to understand the consequences of this, even if all you want is to simply
run a program.
