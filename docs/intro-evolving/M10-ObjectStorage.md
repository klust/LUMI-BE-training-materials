# LUMI-O Object Storage

LUMI also has an object storage system. It is useful as a staging location
to transfer data to LUMI, but some programs may also benefit from accessing the 
object storage directly.
We highlight the differences
between a parallel filesystem such as Lustre and object storage, and discuss how
LuMI-O can be accessed.
